/**
 *
 * The linked list library provides a set of functions for
 * manipulating linked lists.
 *
 * A linked list is made up of elements where the first element
 * must be a pointer. This pointer is used by the linked list library
 * to form lists of the elements.
 *
 * Lists are declared with the LIST() macro. The declaration specifies
 * the name of the list that later is used with all list functions.
 *
 * Lists can be manipulated by inserting or removing elements from
 * either sides of the list (list_push(), list_append(), list_pop(),
 * list_chop()). A specified element can also be removed from inside a
 * list with list_remove(). The head and tail of a list can be
 * extracted using list_head() and list_tail(), respectively.

 * being a pointer. This pointer is used by the linked list library to
 * form the linked lists.
 *
 * Internally, the list is defined as two items: the list itself and a
 * pointer to the list. The pointer has the name of the parameter to

 * and the suffix "_list". The pointer must point to the list for the
 * list to work. Thus the list must be initialized before using.
